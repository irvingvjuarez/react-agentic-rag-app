# Agentic React App with ReactJS and LlamaIndex

Welcome to the **Agentic React App** project! This repository provides the code and instructions for creating a dynamic, intelligent web application using ReactJS and the LlamaIndex LLM framework. The goal of this project is to demonstrate how to integrate a large language model (LLM) into a React application to create interactive and agentic user experiences.

## Introduction

This project showcases the integration of ReactJS with the LlamaIndex framework to build a responsive and interactive web application. LlamaIndex leverages the power of large language models to provide intelligent responses and dynamic content generation, enhancing the overall user experience.

## Features

- **Interactive User Interface:** Built with ReactJS for a responsive and dynamic user experience.
- **Intelligent Responses:** Utilizes LlamaIndex to generate context-aware and meaningful responses.
- **Modular and Scalable:** Designed with modularity in mind, allowing easy extension and customization.
- **Easy Setup:** Simple installation and configuration process to get started quickly.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/irvingvjuarez/react-agentic-rag-app.git
    cd react-agentic-rag-app
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    Your app should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can interact with it by entering queries in the input field. The LlamaIndex framework processes the input and generates intelligent responses displayed in the application.

## Configuration

You can customize various aspects of the application by modifying the configuration files and components:

- **API Configuration:** Update the `.env` file with your LlamaIndex API key and other necessary configurations.
- **Components:** Modify the React components in the `src` directory to customize the UI and behavior of the application.
- **Styling:** Update the CSS files in the `src` directory to change the look and feel of the application.
